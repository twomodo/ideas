# Twomodo Startup Ideas

**Twomodo** is not a team. It's a mode.  
A mode of thinking, building, and validating software with clarity and speed.

This repository contains early-stage product ideas that follow the **Twomodo philosophy**:
- 🧠 Lightweight concepts that solve real, focused problems  
- ⚙️ MVPs built fast with minimal code, zero operational overhead  
- 📊 Designed for validation in global markets  
- 💬 Supported via async feedback and ticket-based systems only

## 🧭 What is Twomodo?

Twomodo is a product-building framework — part mindset, part method.  
It’s how we turn raw ideas into working, validated micro-startups without unnecessary meetings, infrastructure, or complexity.

> Build light. Move fast. Learn faster.

We believe:
- Signal comes before scale  
- Tools should support execution, not slow it down  
- A clear problem and a fast prototype is better than a bloated plan

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each idea lives in its own directory:

```
/ideas/
├── 001-resume-ai/
│   ├── README.md         # Overview of the idea
│   ├── problem.md        # Clear articulation of the problem
│   ├── solution.md       # Proposed solution and key features
│   ├── mvp.md            # What MVP includes (and excludes)
│   ├── personas.md       # Target users and user stories
│   ├── competitors.md    # Competitive scan

│   ├── roadmap.md        # Optional growth ideas
│   └── notes.md          # Research, links, raw thoughts
```

Folder naming convention:  
`{index}-{short-slug}` — e.g. `001-resume-ai`, `002-copywriter`, etc.
