# Twomodo Startup Ideas

**Twomodo** is not a team. It's a mode.  
A mode of thinking, building, and validating software with clarity and speed.

This repository contains early-stage product ideas that follow the **Twomodo philosophy**:
- 🧠 Lightweight concepts that solve real, focused problems  
- ⚙️ MVPs built fast with minimal code, zero operational overhead  
- 📊 Designed for validation in global markets  
- 💬 Supported via async feedback and ticket-based systems only

## 🧭 What is Twomodo?

Twomodo is a product-building framework — part mindset, part method.  
It’s how we turn raw ideas into working, validated micro-startups without unnecessary meetings, infrastructure, or complexity.

> Build light. Move fast. Learn faster.

We believe:
- Signal comes before scale  
- Tools should support execution, not slow it down  
- A clear problem and a fast prototype is better than a bloated plan
