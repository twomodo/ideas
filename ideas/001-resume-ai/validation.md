# Market Validation

> 📊 Ensure this idea is backed by demand, real user behavior, and growing trends.

## Key Hypotheses

1. Job seekers struggle to write effective, ATS-friendly resumes on their own.
2. Many users don’t tailor resumes to job descriptions due to time or lack of skill.
3. AI-generated resumes and cover letters are acceptable to users if the output is clear and saves time.
4. Users are more likely to complete and use resume builders if friction is removed (e.g. via integrations, motivation, and context-awareness).

## Validation Sources

- **Jobscan.co** reports that **75%+** of resumes are rejected by ATS bots before reaching recruiters.
- Google Trends shows stable interest in the term “resume builder” and increasing search traffic around “AI resume generator.”
- Competitors like Zety and Novoresume have **10M+ monthly visits** combined, despite being paywalled and limited in automation.
- AI content tools (e.g. ChatGPT) are now widely accepted for resume writing, according to Reddit and ResumeCritique threads.

## User Interviews (Planned)

Target user groups:
- Recent graduates and junior engineers
- Mid-career professionals switching industries
- Immigrants or job seekers in foreign markets

Interview goals:
- Measure confidence and anxiety levels during resume creation

## Validation Plan

- 🚀 **Chrome Extension Test**: Let users extract job descriptions and preview matching resumes.
- 🧪 **Landing Page Experiment**: Offer resume builder waitlist and measure sign-ups, conversion rate, and click-through on features.
- 🧠 **Prompt A/B Tests**: Measure which AI prompt styles generate the highest “copy and export” rate.
