> ðŸ’¡ This is the main overview of your idea. Make it compelling and clear.

## Overview
[Write a 2-3 sentence description of your idea. Example:]

An AI-powered platform that automatically generates and maintains technical documentation from codebases. It uses machine learning to analyze code, comments, and git history to create always-up-to-date documentation that developers actually want to read.

## Key Points
[List 3-5 main selling points. Example:]

- **Problem**: Developers spend 30% of their time reading documentation, yet 70% of projects have outdated or incomplete docs
- **Solution**: AI-powered documentation that stays in sync with your code automatically
- **Innovation**: First tool to use ML for understanding code context and generating human-readable docs
- **Market**: $5B developer tools market, growing 22% annually

## Target Market

### Primary Users
- Software development teams (10-500 developers)
- Open source project maintainers
- Technical documentation writers

### Use Cases
1. Auto-generating API documentation
2. Keeping internal docs up-to-date
3. Creating onboarding materials

## Value Proposition
[Clearly state why users need this. Example:]

For development teams who struggle with maintaining documentation, our tool provides automated, accurate, and always-up-to-date documentation by using AI to analyze code changes in real-time. Unlike traditional documentation tools, we eliminate the manual work while improving quality.
